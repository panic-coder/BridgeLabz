/*7. Write a program Binary.java prints the binary (base 2) representation of the decimal
number typed as the commandÂ­line argument. It is based on decomposing the
number into a sum of powers of 2. For example, the binary representation of 106 is
11010102, which is the same as saying that 106 = 64 + 32 + 8 + 2. Ensure
necessary padding to represent 4 Byte String.
To compute the binary representation of n, we consider the powers of 2 less than or
equal to n in decreasing order to determine which belong in the binary
decomposition (and therefore correspond to a 1 bit in the binary representation).*/
